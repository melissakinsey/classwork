      <h1>Freddie Mercury: Old-School Fabulous</h1>
        <p>
        Freddie Mercury, lead vocalist of the rock band "Queen," was a charismatic British singer, songwriter, and record producer. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage presence and four-octave vocal range. With his highly theatrical style, Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman, influencing rock 'n' roll history for decades to come.</p>
        
        <p>As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1991, Mercury died at age 45 from complications of AIDS.
